Apache Maven 3 is required to build Apache Commons Weaver. Things to know:

### Site building issues
The Commons Weaver site includes the report generated by the
[clirr-maven-plugin](http://www.mojohaus.org/clirr-maven-plugin/) which is
currently unable to run on Java 8. Also, the Commons Weaver site generation
process runs out of permgen space when built with default JVM settings (on
applicable Java versions); the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable can be used to
set `MaxPermSize`. `-XX:MaxPermSize=128m` seems to be adequate on Java 7.
